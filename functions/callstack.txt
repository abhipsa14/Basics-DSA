-Everytime a function is called, it gets created in the stack memory.
-All the local variables belonging to that function are part of the stack frame.
-Once the function call, the stack frame is cleared off.
-The function that is currently is always at the top of the stack.

Let's take example of binomial program in the folder;
1. main()--> first created and is the top of the stack
2. bincoff()--> is called by main() function and then top of stack points to it.
3. fact()--> it is called by bincoff() again and again....and then, fact is removed from the stack...and then top points back to the bincoff() function.
