Function call
 to call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses() and a semicolon ';'
 can be called more than once, as many times you want, performs same logic.
 you can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

---> Parameters: they act as variables inside the function. you can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma. 

A C++ function consists of two parts:
1. Declaration - the function's name, return type, and parameters(if any)
2. Definition - the body of the function (code to be executed)

function must be declared before it is called.
--->Forward declaration
